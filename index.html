        <h3>
          the computer mouse is one of the most ubiquitous computing technologies to date.
        </h3>

        <img src="star-trek.jpg" alt="screenshot from Star Trek Four: using compter mouse as a walkie talkie" />

        <p>Yet users of the mouse don't really think about it's structure, let alone it's material. They use it as if it were a required technology for computing. What if all computers were still text based? What if the mouse was more intertwined with the keyboard like Doug Engelbart's chord set? What if the mouse was a foot pedal? What about the mouse tells you that it is for your hand? What about the mouse tells you that it is meant only to be used with a computer?</p>

        <p>The mouse was invented in 1968 by Douglas C. Engelbart who previously had done a PhD in Electrical Engineering at UoC and had researched at Stanford Research Institute. During that time, to no avail, he tried to get more people interested interactive computing. Finally in 1963 Engelbart made a project proposal for experimenting with different tools for interacting with information on the computer screen. He was granted money by NASA and started to do user testing for existing technologies like the track ball and the light pen. Engelbart and his colleague Bill English prototyped a new device that would measure the x-y axes in a similar manner to previous tools but with a device that had a ball and two wheels which when moved at right angles could calculate the distance between points in a two dimensional are. The display of the cursor is only a by-product of this calculation<sup>1</sup>.</p>

        <p>From an engineering perspective the structure of the mouse is quite simple: two potentiometers, one ball, one or two buttons. Today mice are often built with optical sensors instead of ponetiometers but the logic of mapping relative x and y coordinates from the desk to the desktop remains the same.</p>

        <p>Speaking of the desk...why is the desk our one and only metaphor for personal computing. What is the relationship between the desk and the keyboard and the mouse? What does it mean that mice were mainly used in offices and everything done in the early days of personal computing was done through the lenes of the office?</p>

        <p>Typing, with typewriters and computers, has been historically feminized. It was extremely rare to see an image of a man typing. In contrast to PC Mag claimed in their 1983 issue that early mouse users were mostly men. Even when computers were commonplace in offices they were still seen as idealized typing machines so if there was an image of a man next to a computer he would probably not be typing on it. The mouse helped to change this perception of computer as typing machine which in effect shifted perceptions around computing in general.</p>

        <p>How is the mouse representative of labor, or in the case of surveillance capitalism, human behavior?</p>
